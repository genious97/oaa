## What makes a sensitive issue?

An issue can be considered sensitive if it falls into any of the following criteria:

- The issue in question undermines the safety of data in OAA, the website or any of our products (Such as a security issue)
- The issue in question causes OAA, the website or any of our products to fail (Such as a reliable way to crash OAA)
- The issue does one of the above to the frameworks that our products sits on top of (Such as an issue on OAA that undermines the security of DOTA)

## How should you go about letting us know about it?

1. Get onto the developer Discord
2. Look for the appropriate team and their members
  - Such as the core dev team for OAA or the web dev team for the website
3. DM them the specific issue with the following information:
  - What exactly the issue is
  - EXACTLY how to reproduce the issue
  - ANY information about the issue already being exploited if that is known
  - ANY information associated to the issue that you can provide (Such as code-level stack traces or errors, etc.)
4. DO NOT abuse this!  The developer team members should not be bothered with trivial things, such as balance or color preference.  Please only bother the dev team with serious issues in this manner.  If you are ever in doubt, as yourself `"Would everyone agree that this is a serious issue that must be fixed in the next 10 minutes"`
